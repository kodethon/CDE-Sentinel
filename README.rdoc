== Sentinel

This is a set of tasks that checks the state and health of the nodes and file system clients.

== Development

When you start a development cluster using **start-cluster-dev.sh**, it also starts a sentinel container.

You can attack to the sentinel container to run some of the commands.

For example, you can run `rake admin:check_app`.  But you must set `export NO_HTTPS=true`.
